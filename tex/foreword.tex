This is a collection of topic-discussion level summaries of a myriad of different disease states. The book will be organized into parts by primary organ system / topic, and each chapter will cover a single disease state. 

References will be listed at the end of each chapter. I will do my best to utilize appropriate clinical literature, but ultimately, these summaries are not peer-reviewed and medical decisions should not be made based upon this book.

{\color{linkColor}Links will be colored like this throughout the book.} 

\begin{summarybox}
	This will be the format for section summaries / key points at the start of each chapter. These \textbf{will not} be present in every chapter
\end{summarybox}

\begin{ddbox}{Literature Deep Dive}
	This is the format for description / analysis of major primary literature associated with a given topic. These will be my own personal analysis, and may not be reflective of clinical practice everywhere. They will also be more frequent in topics related to critical care and emergency medicine, as those are my primary interests.
